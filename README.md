# DLP Trigger Tool
## What is this?
Right now, it generates strings that look like names, numbers that look like cc_numbers, 
numbers that look like Social Security Numbers, Strings that look like Maiden names, and 
numbers that look like American telephone numbers. 
## How to use it:
It will work with Python3.7 or higher (I used f strings). If you don't want to use python3.7 or higher,
it will return errors with out editing the f strings in some of the return statements. Other than that,
`python3 app.py` will run the script, and generate `names.csv`. 
## Why use it?
I needed it to test a DLP solution. I can't thing of any reason other than that to use it. 
## Future Features
I plan to make this a little more robust. I eventually want it to generate things that will trigger
DLP rules based on the major compliance things we look for. 
## I want to help:
If you see something I could do better or just want to add something I missed:
    1. Fork the Repo
    2. Add/change your thing
    3. Submit a PR to the dev branch
    4. After I review it, I will merge it.
